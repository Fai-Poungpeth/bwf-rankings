### Outline
The following ShinyApp is a project I worked on to create an interactive platform for people interested in badminton to see changes in the Badminton World Federation (BWF) Rankings over time, and for users to compare ranking data between different top players of a certain period of time.

### Data
The data used for this project came from a Kaggle dataset, linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentindefour/badminton-world-rankings-updated-august-2020. The actual database can also be found in this repo.
